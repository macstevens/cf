                        C FLAT

C Flat, also known as Factored C, is an extension of C++.

No global variables.
No local variables.
Only class member variables.
No member functions.
Only global functions of the form void F(X).



class Point
{
    mX, mY
}

SetX(p, x)
{
    assert(p.type == Point);

}




Development Cycle
1. Make feature request/test/assertion.  Enable/disable assertion(s).
2. Run test(s).  Use software.
3. Notice error/outpoint.  Record error.  Log bug.
4. Get more information.  Narrow area of investigation.  Go to step 1 or 5
5. Make change.  If situation matches some pattern, implement pattern solution.  Go to step 1 or 2.







Recognize duplicate or similar code.  When code changes, make assertion or suggestion that the corresponding similar code should change.



Not just pass/fail assertions.  Also, suggestions (of possible errors, or of things to try), warnings (possible errors), %certainty of error.  Capable of turning on or off assertions for a given time period or given situation.  Snooze button.


Automatically test the envelope of limits on input & output
